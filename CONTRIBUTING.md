## How can I contribute

In order to contribute code upstream, you need to have good knowledge of ES6 Javascript and React. 

1. Choose an open issue that you want to contribute to.
1. Fork the repository on GitHub. This is necessary so that you can push your changes, as you can't do this directly on our repo
3. Follow the steps from the Readme to get set up with a local instance of timemap
4. When you're ready to submit a contribution, you can do it by making a pull request from a branch on your forked copy of timemap to this repository. You can find more information in the [Git workflow](WORKFLOW.md).
